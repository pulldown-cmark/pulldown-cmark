## Strikethrough (extension)

GFM enables the `strikethrough` extension, where an additional emphasis type is
available.

Strikethrough text is any text wrapped in a matching pair of one or two tildes (`~`).

```````````````````````````````` example
~~Hi~~ Hello, ~there~ world!
.
<p><del>Hi</del> Hello, <del>there</del> world!</p>
````````````````````````````````

As with regular emphasis delimiters, a new paragraph will cause strikethrough
parsing to cease:

```````````````````````````````` example
This ~~has a

new paragraph~~.
.
<p>This ~~has a</p>
<p>new paragraph~~.</p>
````````````````````````````````

Three or more tildes do not create a strikethrough:

```````````````````````````````` example
This will ~~~not~~~ strike.
.
<p>This will ~~~not~~~ strike.</p>
````````````````````````````````
