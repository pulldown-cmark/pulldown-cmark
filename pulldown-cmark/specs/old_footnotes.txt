Run this with `cargo test --features gen-tests suite::old_footnotes`.

This is how footnotes are basically used.

```````````````````````````````` example_old_footnotes
Lorem ipsum.[^a]

[^a]: Cool.
.
<p>Lorem ipsum.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#a">1</a></sup></p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="a"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Cool.</p>
</div>
````````````````````````````````


Footnotes can be used inside blockquotes:

```````````````````````````````` example_old_footnotes
> This is the song that never ends.\
> Yes it goes on and on my friends.[^lambchops]
>
> [^lambchops]: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U2zJOryHKQ>
.
<blockquote>
<p>This is the song that never ends.<br />
Yes it goes on and on my friends.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#lambchops">1</a></sup></p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="lambchops"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U2zJOryHKQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U2zJOryHKQ</a></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````


Footnotes can be complex block structures:

```````````````````````````````` example_old_footnotes
Songs that simply loop are a popular way to annoy people. [^examples]

[^examples]:
 * [The song that never ends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U2zJOryHKQ)
 * [I know a song that gets on everybody's nerves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TehWI09qxls)
 * [Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVjCag8XoHQ)
.
<p>Songs that simply loop are a popular way to annoy people. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#examples">1</a></sup></p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="examples"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U2zJOryHKQ">The song that never ends</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVjCag8XoHQ">Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
````````````````````````````````


Footnotes can even have multiple paragraphs. They also don't need to be referenced to show up.

```````````````````````````````` example_old_footnotes
[^lorem]: If heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon, it will be a total effacing of the results of a mere chance which fixed my eye on a certain stray piece of shelf-paper. It was nothing on which I would naturally have stumbled in the course of my daily round, for it was an old number of an Australian journal, the Sydney Bulletin for April 18, 1925. It had escaped even the cutting bureau which had at the time of its issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncle's research.

I had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor Angell called the "Cthulhu Cult", and was visiting a learned friend in Paterson, New Jersey; the curator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note. Examining one day the reserve specimens roughly set on the storage shelves in a rear room of the museum, my eye was caught by an odd picture in one of the old papers spread beneath the stones. It was the Sydney Bulletin I have mentioned, for my friend had wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture was a half-tone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which Legrasse had found in the swamp.

A footnote will end on a single line break. Note that this behavior changed in version
0.1.0, to become more like hoedown. See issue #21.

```````````````````````````````` example_old_footnotes
[^ipsum]: How much wood would a woodchuck chuck.

If a woodchuck could chuck wood.


# Forms of entertainment that aren't childish
.
<div class="footnote-definition" id="ipsum"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>How much wood would a woodchuck chuck.</p>
</div>
<p>If a woodchuck could chuck wood.</p>
<h1>Forms of entertainment that aren't childish</h1>
````````````````````````````````


A footnote will also break if it's inside another container.

```````````````````````````````` example_old_footnotes
> He's also really stupid. [^why]
>
> [^why]: Because your mamma!

As such, we can guarantee that the non-childish forms of entertainment are probably more entertaining to adults, since, having had a whole childhood doing the childish ones, the non-childish ones are merely the ones that haven't gotten boring yet.
.
<blockquote>
<p>He's also really stupid. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#why">1</a></sup></p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="why"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>

</div>

As a special exception, footnotes cannot be nested directly inside each other.

```````````````````````````````` example_old_footnotes
Nested footnotes are considered poor style. [^a] [^xkcd]

[^a]: This does not mean that footnotes cannot reference each other. [^b]

[^b]: This means that a footnote definition cannot be directly inside another footnote definition.
> This means that a footnote cannot be directly inside another footnote's body. [^e]
>
> [^e]: They can, however, be inside anything else.

[^xkcd]: [The other kind of nested footnote is, however, considered poor style.](https://xkcd.com/1208/)
.
<p>Nested footnotes are considered poor style. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#a">1</a></sup> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#xkcd">2</a></sup></p>

</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="b"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">3</sup>

<blockquote>

````````````````````````````````

They do need one line between each other.

```````````````````````````````` example_old_footnotes
[^Doh] Ray Me Fa So La Te Do! [^1]

[^Doh]: I know. Wrong Doe. And it will render right.
[^1]: Common for people practicing music.
.
<p><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#Doh">1</a></sup> Ray Me Fa So La Te Do! <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">2</a></sup></p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="Doh"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup><p>I know. Wrong Doe. And it will render right.</p></div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup><p>Common for people practicing music.</p></div>
````````````````````````````````

Second check for footnotes:

```````````````````````````````` example
[Reference to footnotes A[^1], B[^2] and C[^3].

[^1]: Footnote A.
[^2]: Footnote B.
[^3]: Footnote C.
.
<p>[Reference to footnotes A<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, B<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> and C<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup>.</p><div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup><p>Footnote A.</p></div><div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup><p>Footnote B.</p></div><div class="footnote-definition" id="3"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">3</sup><p>Footnote C.</p></div>
````````````````````````````````

Multiple footnotes should be able without needing whitespace in between.

```````````````````````````````` example
Lorem ipsum.[^a][^b]

[^a]: Foo
[^b]: Bar
.
<p>Lorem ipsum.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#a">1</a></sup><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#b">2</a></sup></p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="a"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Foo</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="b"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>Bar</p>
</div>
````````````````````````````````

This does work already:

```````````````````````````````` example
Lorem ipsum.[^a] [^b]

[^a]: Foo
[^b]: Bar
.
<p>Lorem ipsum.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#a">1</a></sup> <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#b">2</a></sup></p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="a"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Foo</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="b"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>Bar</p>
</div>
