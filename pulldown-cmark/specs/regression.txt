ISSUE #917

Technically, commonmark only requires our nesting cutoff to stop at 3.
However, real user reports show that this limit is low enough to hit in reasonable circumstances.
We instead set the limit at 32, which is the same limit used by cmark-gfm and markdown-it (making it a de facto standard).
