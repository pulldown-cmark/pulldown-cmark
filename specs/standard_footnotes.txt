Run this with `cargo test suite::standard_footnotes`.

This is how footnotes are basically used.

Footnotes can even have multiple paragraphs. They *do* need to be referenced to show up, but they *don't* have to appear in order.

[^lorem]: If heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon, it will be a total effacing of the results of a mere chance which fixed my eye on a certain stray piece of shelf-paper. It was nothing on which I would naturally have stumbled in the course of my daily round, for it was an old number of an Australian journal, the Sydney Bulletin for April 18, 1925. It had escaped even the cutting bureau which had at the time of its issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncle's research.

    I had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor Angell called the "Cthulhu Cult", and was visiting a learned friend in Paterson, New Jersey; the curator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note. Examining one day the reserve specimens roughly set on the storage shelves in a rear room of the museum, my eye was caught by an odd picture in one of the old papers spread beneath the stones. It was the Sydney Bulletin I have mentioned, for my friend had wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture was a half-tone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which Legrasse had found in the swamp.

A footnote will end on a double line break if the next item is not indented to a block level, just like a list item.

A footnote will also break if it's inside another container.

```````````````````````````````` example_standard_footnotes
> He's also really stupid. [^why]

> [^why]: Because your mamma!

As such, we can guarantee that the non-childish forms of entertainment are probably more entertaining to adults, since, having had a whole childhood doing the childish ones, the non-childish ones are merely the ones that haven't gotten boring yet.

As a special exception, footnotes cannot be nested directly inside each other.

[^a]: This does not mean that footnotes cannot reference each other. [^b]

While it's easier to read the source if they have one line between each other, they render correctly (starting a new definition) regardless.
