## Task list items (extension)

GFM enables the `tasklist` extension, where an additional processing step is
performed on [list items].

A [task list item](@) is a [list item][list items] where the first block in it
is a paragraph which begins with a [task list item marker] and at least one
whitespace character before any other content.

A [task list item marker](@) consists of an optional number of spaces, a left
bracket (`[`), either a whitespace character or the letter `x` in either
lowercase or uppercase, and then a right bracket (`]`).

When rendered, the [task list item marker] is replaced with a semantic checkbox element;
in an HTML output, this would be an `<input type="checkbox">` element.

If the character between the brackets is a whitespace character, the checkbox
is unchecked.  Otherwise, the checkbox is checked.

This spec does not define how the checkbox elements are interacted with: in practice,
implementors are free to render the checkboxes as disabled or inmutable elements,
or they may dynamically handle dynamic interactions (i.e. checking, unchecking) in
the final rendered document.

```````````````````````````````` example
- [ ] foo
- [x] bar
.
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"/>
foo</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
bar</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````

Task lists can be arbitrarily nested:

```````````````````````````````` example
- [x] foo
  - [ ] bar
  - [x] baz
- [ ] bim
.
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
foo
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"/>
bar</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
baz</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"/>
bim</li>
</ul>
